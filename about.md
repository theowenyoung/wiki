## About the Wiki

Since I found [Everything I know](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz), I was fascinated by this concept, about the wiki, second brain, lifetime notes, backlinks, tags. I realized that "Yes, this is what I want to do", I used to create many blogs, Tumblr, WordPress, Hexo, Hugo, Gatsbyjs, etc. But I do not post too many posts, cause there is a certain cost for a blog post. But not for note/wiki. And also I like tags, wiki links for connecting my notes, and there are no other themes that support this. So I created a new [Gatsby theme](https://github.com/theowenyoung/gatsby-theme-primer-wiki) for this. If you you want to build a wiki like this, you can get started from [this foam template](https://github.com/theowenyoung/foam-template-gatsby-theme-primer-wiki) or [obsidian template](https://github.com/theowenyoung/obsidian-template-gatsby-theme-primer-wiki) if you prefer Obsidian.

Now , I'am using [foam](https://github.com/foambubble/foam) and [obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) to edit the wiki.

## About Me

### A failure of English learning

I've learned English more than 10 years, but it still sucks, so I registered a Twitter [@TheOwenYoung](https://twitter.com/TheOwenYoung) for only English tweets, and this [wiki](https://wiki.owenyoung.com) and [blog](https://blog.owenyoung.com) to force me to use more English.

### Programmer
