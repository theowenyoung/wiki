Since I found [Everything I know](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz), I realized that "Yes, this is what I want to do", I used to create many blogs, tumblr, wordpress, hexo, hugo, gatsbyjs etc. But I do not post too much posts, cause there is a certain cost for blog post. But not for note.

So I hope it's a gift for my grandchildren(if I have :)

Why I build this?

- Knowledge that is not remembered/not found is useless
- My memory is poor
- I am eager to show(show off) what I know
- The cost of writing a blog is high, but the cost of writing notes is low
- I need a non-vendor locked solution to motivate me to record permanently
