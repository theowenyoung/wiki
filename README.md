> A personal knowledge based wiki, where I share everything I know. I will be updating this wiki quite often as I use it myself daily both to keep an account of things I know as well as things I want to know and everything in-between. More details see [[about]]. I hope it's a gift for my grandchildren(if I have :)

## Why I build this?

- Knowledge that is not remembered/not found is useless
- My memory is poor
- I am eager to show(show off) what I know
- Records make me feel like I'm not wasting my time
- The cost of writing a blog is high, but the cost of writing notes is low
- I need a non-vendor locked solution to motivate me to record permanently
- Plain text is forever
