> A personal knowledge based wiki, where I share everything I know. I will be updating this wiki quite often as I use it myself daily both to keep an account of things I know as well as things I want to know and everything in-between.

Since I found [Everything I know](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz), I was fascinated by this concept, about the wiki, second brain, lifetime notes, backlinks, tags. I realized that "Yes, this is what I want to do", I used to create many blogs, Tumblr, WordPress, Hexo, Hugo, Gatsbyjs, etc. But I do not post too many posts, cause there is a certain cost for a blog post. But not for note/wiki. And also I like tags, wiki links for connecting my notes, and there are no other themes that support this. So I created a new [Gatsby theme](https://github.com/theowenyoung/gatsby-theme-primer-wiki) for this. If you you want to build a wiki like this, you can get started from [this foam template](https://github.com/theowenyoung/foam-template-gatsby-theme-primer-wiki) or [obsidian template](https://github.com/theowenyoung/obsidian-template-gatsby-theme-primer-wiki) if you prefer Obsidian.

Now , I'am using [foam](https://github.com/foambubble/foam) and [obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) to edit the wiki.

I hope it's a gift for my grandchildren(if I have :)

## Why I build this?

- Knowledge that is not remembered/not found is useless
- My memory is poor
- I am eager to show(show off) what I know
- Records make me feel like I'm not wasting my time
- The cost of writing a blog is high, but the cost of writing notes is low
- I need a non-vendor locked solution to motivate me to record permanently
- Plain text is forever

## How I build this?

The source and site are hosted on [GitHub - theowenyoung/wiki: Personal Knowledge Base Wiki, Everything I Know.](https://github.com/theowenyoung/wiki)

I am proud to have developed my own theme [GitHub - theowenyoung/gatsby-theme-primer-wiki: Gatsby Theme Primer Wiki](https://github.com/theowenyoung/gatsby-theme-primer-wiki), If you want to build your own wiki like this, you can follow [GitHub - theowenyoung/foam-template-gatsby-theme-primer-wiki](https://github.com/theowenyoung/foam-template-gatsby-theme-primer-wiki) or [obsidian-template-gatsby-theme-primer-wiki](https://github.com/theowenyoung/obsidian-template-gatsby-theme-primer-wiki) if you prefer Obsidian.
